**UPDATE** @derberg 

I created [this branch](https://github.com/AnimeshKumar923/asyncapi-community/tree/folder-deletion-test) to test out the changes.

I made three commits to the branch and updated 3 with three video IDs.

**Results:**
- [1st one](https://github.com/AnimeshKumar923/asyncapi-community/actions/runs/5588589628/jobs/10215605863) failed. Don't know the reason. Maybe you can help me understand the error. @akshatnema 
- [2nd case](https://github.com/AnimeshKumar923/asyncapi-community/actions/runs/5590649427/jobs/10220641569) ran successfully. [Results](https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/animeshkumar923/episodes/RIP-Google-Domains-and-5-big-tech-stories-this-week-e273eg1)
- [3rd case](https://github.com/AnimeshKumar923/asyncapi-community/actions/runs/5590712370/jobs/10220791953) ran successfully. [Results](https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/animeshkumar923/episodes/Twitter-algorithm-open-sourced-Is-Elon-playing-5D-chess-e273er8)

The latter 2 episodes got published directly. I'm thinking of adding the `SAVE_AS_DRAFT: true` so that @thulieblack can give this a check and make required changes (if any) before publishing on Spotify Podcast. Thoughts? @thulieblack
