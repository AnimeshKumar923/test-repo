I have some questions and suggestions to discuss that may improve [this doc](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/tutorials/create-asyncapi-document):

- Can [this line](https://github.com/asyncapi/website/blob/81118d45b14b4676d1b63f7b033bb63eb7b92ad7/pages/docs/tutorials/create-asyncapi-document.md?plain=1#L17) be changed at the end from `environmental lighting` to `environmental lighting conditions` as the same is given [here](https://github.com/asyncapi/website/blob/81118d45b14b4676d1b63f7b033bb63eb7b92ad7/pages/docs/tutorials/create-asyncapi-document.md?plain=1#L69)?
- Can the `Event-driven architecture (EDA)` [here](https://github.com/asyncapi/website/blob/81118d45b14b4676d1b63f7b033bb63eb7b92ad7/pages/docs/tutorials/create-asyncapi-document.md?plain=1#L28) put in bold letters?
- Removing one extra full stop (.) from the end of [this line](https://github.com/asyncapi/website/blob/81118d45b14b4676d1b63f7b033bb63eb7b92ad7/pages/docs/tutorials/create-asyncapi-document.md?plain=1#L40)
- The `d` in the Id [here](https://github.com/asyncapi/website/blob/81118d45b14b4676d1b63f7b033bb63eb7b92ad7/pages/docs/tutorials/create-asyncapi-document.md?plain=1#L79) can capitalized.
- `Let's break it down into pieces:` can be changed to `Let's break the above code snippet down into pieces:` [here](https://github.com/asyncapi/website/blob/81118d45b14b4676d1b63f7b033bb63eb7b92ad7/pages/docs/tutorials/create-asyncapi-document.md?plain=1#L90)
- `lets` can be changed to `let's` [here](https://github.com/asyncapi/website/blob/81118d45b14b4676d1b63f7b033bb63eb7b92ad7/pages/docs/tutorials/create-asyncapi-document.md?plain=1#L119)
- Also on the [same line as above](https://github.com/asyncapi/website/blob/81118d45b14b4676d1b63f7b033bb63eb7b92ad7/pages/docs/tutorials/create-asyncapi-document.md?plain=1#L119), `This section is used to describe the event names your API will be publishing and/or subscribing to.`, we can change it to `This section is used to describe the event names that your API will be publishing and/or subscribing to.
- `Next is the payload property which is used to understand how the event should look like when publishing to that channel:` it can be changed to `Next is the payload property. It is used to understand how the event should look like when publishing to that channel` [here](https://github.com/asyncapi/website/blob/81118d45b14b4676d1b63f7b033bb63eb7b92ad7/pages/docs/tutorials/create-asyncapi-document.md?plain=1#L131)

[ðŸ“‘ Docs]: suggestions on 'event-driven-architecture' file |
							   |
============================================================

I have some questions and suggestions to discuss that may improve [this doc](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/tutorials/getting-started/event-driven-architectures):

- `adding a shopping item to a cart on an e-commerce website.` can be changed to `adding an item to a shopping cart on an e-commerce website` [here](https://github.com/asyncapi/website/blob/81118d45b14b4676d1b63f7b033bb63eb7b92ad7/pages/docs/tutorials/getting-started/event-driven-architectures.md?plain=1#L27C155-L27C259)

- [This](https://github.com/asyncapi/website/blob/81118d45b14b4676d1b63f7b033bb63eb7b92ad7/pages/docs/tutorials/getting-started/event-driven-architectures.md?plain=1#L59C74-L59C130) can be changed from `You will even find _"message-based"_ and _"event-based"_` to `You will even find _"message-based"_ and _"event-based"_ being used instead of _"message-driven"_ and _"event-driven"_.`

- Changing `_event-driven_` to `_"event-driven"_` [here](https://github.com/asyncapi/website/blob/81118d45b14b4676d1b63f7b033bb63eb7b92ad7/pages/docs/tutorials/getting-started/event-driven-architectures.md?plain=1#L61C107-L61C123) to maintain consistency.

- Can we add [Martin Fowler's wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Fowler_(software_engineer)) [here](https://github.com/asyncapi/website/blob/81118d45b14b4676d1b63f7b033bb63eb7b92ad7/pages/docs/tutorials/getting-started/event-driven-architectures.md?plain=1#L63C41-L63C54) in-case someone is interested in getting information about him?

=========================================================

I have some questions and suggestions to discuss that may improve [this doc](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/tutorials/getting-started/coming-from-openapi):

- In [this line](https://github.com/asyncapi/website/blob/8549ce7a9de9fa1b59d311c9082061826af9ef20/pages/docs/tutorials/getting-started/coming-from-openapi.md?plain=1#L10C186-L10C288), I propose we change `We wanted to have as much compatibility as possible between the two so users could reuse parts in both.` to `We wanted to have as much compatibility as possible between the two so that the users could reuse parts in both.`

- Can [this](https://github.com/asyncapi/website/blob/8549ce7a9de9fa1b59d311c9082061826af9ef20/pages/docs/tutorials/getting-started/coming-from-openapi.md?plain=1#L12C103-L12C129) be written like this `Event-Driven Architectures`? Because I've seen it being used like this.
- Can we add a redirection link to `Avro schema.` documentation [here](https://github.com/asyncapi/website/blob/8549ce7a9de9fa1b59d311c9082061826af9ef20/pages/docs/tutorials/getting-started/coming-from-openapi.md?plain=1#L21C116-L21C127)? If someone wants to understand what is `Avro schema`, they can read the docs. I'm guessing there is a documentation on this from AsyncAPI as I recall I've read the word `Avro` somewhere in docs before.
