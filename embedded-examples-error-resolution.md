```

## Solution for this error
For the resolution, what I found out from my observation is that if we remove this line:

```json
"authorizationUrl": "https://example.com/api/oauth/dialog",
```
from the examples in the spec, the files become valid.

and we remove the same line from the yaml file as well.

I tried removing this line from the invalid document in the Studio validator and the file became valid

Maybe I'm wrong and we need to modify something else? I don't know as of now...

As far as I understand, it's referencing to some non-existent external example file.

I've tried this in the Studio validator:

- For the `Message Object`, if we remove [this portion](https://github.com/AnimeshKumar923/asyncapi-spec/blob/3ffdb58ce45a7619037be7c77642eb62c33a10a4/scripts/validation/embed-logs/Message%20Object-json-format.json#L479C75-L482C12), the file becomes valid.

- For the `Components Object`, if we remove [this portion](https://github.com/AnimeshKumar923/asyncapi-spec/blob/3ffdb58ce45a7619037be7c77642eb62c33a10a4/scripts/validation/embed-logs/Components%20Object-json-format.json#L263C12-L264C57), the file becomes valid.
