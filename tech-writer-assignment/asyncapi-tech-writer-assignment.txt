An AsyncAPI document is a file through which you can define and describe the various components of a specific Event-Driven API. It is used to define different components of the API (which are slightly distinct from the REST API) to facilitate the asynchronous exchange of messages. The file format of the document must be either JSON or YAML, but only the YAML subset that is compatible with JSON features is allowed.

The AsyncAPI document defines components for your Event-Driven API. This document later gets turned into code that can be easily understood by the machines (which means, you can use them in your own code!). You can then use it to generate documentation, validate all the incoming or outgoing messages sent by your `Example application`, and/or apply policies to the events in the API before they reach the broker.

Hopefully, by now, you have grasped the basics of the "async" API through this article. This parsed document can now be read by various machines (through code) can parse this stuff like it's no big deal. What will they do with it? Endless things. Or nothing at all.

Ready to dive deeper into AsyncAPI? Let's Go!












I'm working for various repositories under the AsyncAPI Organization.



I've worked and reviewed some of the docs which were work-in-progress before the release of the AsyncAPI v3.0.0. I've observed the workflow and process through which a document goes through in the AsyncAPI community.

I'm writing a blog currently (WIP) which describes the workflow which I developed a few months back in the Spec repo.

I think this would be great opportunity to get more experience by getting my hands dirty in the field of technical writing.
Thank you for your time to review my application! Have a great day ahead!
