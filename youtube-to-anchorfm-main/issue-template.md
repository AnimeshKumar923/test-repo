Hey @derberg
I've worked on this issue and got some progress. You can check that here: https://github.com/AnimeshKumar923/asyncapi-community/tree/youtube-to-anchor-workflow

I've also written a documentation which can be accessed here: https://github.com/AnimeshKumar923/asyncapi-community/tree/documentation-on-using-yt-to-anchor-action#note-this-documentation-section-will-remain-only-in-this-forked-repository-and-will-not-be-added-to-main-repository-without-discussing-it-with-the-maintainers

Link to original github action repository: https://github.com/Schrodinger-Hat/youtube-to-anchorfm

Since I didn't have any other ideas as where to add the documentation, I've changed the README.md of the asyncapi/community and put it in a separate branch so that it doesn't get merged with this PR.
We can discuss where to add the documentation.

It can be somewhat confusing so I'm adding the following:

For the testing the workflow, I propose this:

- Read documentation from here: https://github.com/AnimeshKumar923/asyncapi-community/tree/documentation-on-using-yt-to-anchor-action#this-documentation-section-will-remain-only-in-this-forked-repository-and-will-not-be-added-to-main-httpsgithubcomasyncapicommunity-repository-without-discussing-it-with-the-maintainers

- Fork this branch: https://github.com/AnimeshKumar923/asyncapi-community/tree/youtube-to-anchor-workflow
- Make changes to the local fork branch.
- Push changes to local branch.
- Create PR for your local changes.
- I can merge the PR.
- See how the action takes place.
- Resolve any issues which may arise.
- Iterate and improve.

We can discuss about [this](https://github.com/asyncapi/community/issues/621#issuecomment-1461665049) after the `first yt-to-anchor automation` part as it requires testing with WhisperAPI which is now on paid basis and as a student from 'not-so-good' financial background, I can't afford that part to test and integrate. Would require your support if it happens in future. :pray:

Looking forward to hearing from you @derberg @thulie @khuda
